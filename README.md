## What is SatTrack?
SatTrack is a  python-based satellite tracking program.

## Why does this exist?
There are many other programs that do the exact same plus more. They are even more stable.
SatTrack was created for the sole purpose of better interaction with external dish rotors, which isn't actually even possible yet.
Therefore, the purpose of this program is to possibly help someone, who faces the same issue as me.

## SETUP
1. Once the program has started for the first time (or when a settings.db file isn't present), the user will be prompted to enter their observing latitude and longitude.
2. .tle files can be placed in the TLEdata folder. Alternatively, the folder which the program references for .tle files can be changed in the program with "Set TLE Folder" under "File" in the top toolbar.
